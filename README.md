# Pitch-Perfect
A Swift application created to introduce myself to the Swift language. I gained experience in the following classes:
- UIButton
- UILabel
- NSLayoutConstraint
- UIView
- UIViewController
- UINavigationController
- AVAudioPlayer
- AVAudioRecorder
- AVAudioEngine
- AVAudioPlayerNode
- AVAudioUnitTimePitch
and the following frameworks:
- UIKit
- AVFoundation

The application was created as a learning experience only and the orignal source code / tutorial can be found at
